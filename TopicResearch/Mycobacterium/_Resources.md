## FileName

- Ahmed2020<sub>NonTuberculosisMycoANeglectedAndEmergingProblem.pdf</sub>

<a id="orgc0c0bd9"></a>

## Abstract

- The incidence of NTM infections is rising owing to a growing population of
  immunocompromised and vulnerable individuals, complex medical and surgical
  procedures, as well as increased awareness and diagnostic capabilities.

<a id="org8916e53"></a>

## FutureWork

- Simpler and more rapid tests would be ideal in making the diagnosis of NTM
  disease more quickly. However, the development of such tests is complicated
  by the large number of NTM species that can cause disease and by the criteria
  for disease, which require more than just the presence of the microorganism.
  As a result, NTM disease will require multiple diagnostic parameters, leading
  to delays and higher costs. More specific biomarkers to monitor the progress
  of treatment and test cure are lacking.

## Abstract

- Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex taxonomy has rapidly evolved in the last 20
  years through intensive clinical isolation, advances in sequencing and in the
  description of fast-evolving loci (CRISPR and MIRU-VNTR)

- The objectives of this study were 1) to explicit the consensus that exists
  between the alternative taxonomies, and 2) to provide an on-line tool to ease
  classification of new isolates. Genotyping (24-VNTR, 43-spacers spoli-
  gotypes, IS6110-RFLP) was undertaken for 3,454 clinical isolates from the
  Netherlands (2004-2008). The resulting database was enlarged with African
  isolates to include most human tuberculosis diversity. Assignations were
  obtained using TB-Lineage, MIRU- VNTRPlus, SITVITWEB and an algorithm from
  Borile et al

- Original and consensus assignations of the all isolates from the database were
  subsequently implemented into an ensemble learning approach based on Machine
  Learning tool Weka to derive a classification scheme.

- When applied to independent datasets, it was able to suggest new sublineages
  such as pseudo-Beijing. This Lineage Prediction tool, efficient on 15-MIRU,
  24-VNTR and spoligotype data is available on the web interface “TBminer.”

- We successfully used Machine Learning on a large dataset to set up and make
  available the first consensual taxonomy for human Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  complex

<a id="orgcdb172f"></a>

## Conclusion

- We developed an approach making use of standard typing data for human M.

tuberculosis isolates to infer a consensual taxonomy concordant with most
up-to-date data on Whole Genome Sequencing diversity.

- We hope that the same approach can benefit other human pathogens having
  alternative taxonomies according to Serotypes, CRISPRtypes, MLST-types such as
  Salmo- nella, Listeria, Brucella, and more broadly to other organisms such as
  bacterial plant- pathogens.

  to avoid costly and laborious yet not-always-deterministic experiments to
  determine drug–target interactions (DTIs) by experiments alone
- In this article, we describe the data required for the task of DTI prediction
  followed by a comprehensive catalog consisting of machine learning methods and
  databases, which have been proposed and utilized to predict DTIs
- The advantages and disadvantages of each set of methods are also briefly
  discussed

<a id="org625af57"></a>

## Conclusion

- Almost all the methods used in DTI prediction, particularly similarity-based
  methods, heavily rely on assertions concerning similar drugs and similar
  targets, the type of database used for the prediction plays a significant
  role.
- Future predictions should rely on more comprehensive inter- nal databases,
  which would require a significant effort to map and curate data across the
  sources that utilize different ways to define, name and identify the drugs and
  targets.

## Abstract

- The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a
  unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities

- We first introduce major technique barriers and proposed system architecture

- The first activity aims to develop large-scale, real-world and well-annotated
  X-ray image database dedicated for automated TB screening.

  computational models (in particularly, deep convolutional neural networks
  (CNN)-based models) to classify the image into different category of TB
  manifestations

- Our future work includes: (1) to further improve the performance of the
  algorithms; and (2) to deploy our system in the city of Carabayllo in Perú, a
  densely occupied urban community and high-burden TB

<a id="org32b15ca"></a>

## Conclusion

## Abstract

- Using targeted or whole genome sequencing and conventional drug resistance
  phenotyping data from 3,601 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, 1,228 of which
  were multidrug resistant, we implemented the first multitask deep learning
  framework to predict phenotypic drug resistance to 10 anti-tubercular drugs

- The proposed wide and deep neural network (WDNN) achieved improved predictive
  performance compared to regularized logistic regression and random forest

<a id="orge1b6fb3"></a>

## Conclusion

- We demonstrate that L2 regression and MD-WDNN trained on a larger diverse
  dataset using a method of aggregating rare variants outperforms our previously
  reported random forest model. (Chen, 2018)

- A few prior studies have utilized algorithmic or machine learning methods
  using genomic data to account for the complex relationship between genotype
  and drug resistance in MTB

<a id="orgaa7b1b7"></a>

## Abstract

- Whole genome sequencing of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates
  promises to circumvent the long wait times and limited scope of conventional
  phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility, but gaps remain for predicting
  phenotype accurately from genotypic data especially for certain drugs.

- We collected targeted or whole genome sequencing and conventional drug
  resistance phenotyping data from 3601 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains
  enriched for resistance to first- and second-line drugs, with 1228 multidrug
  resistant strains

- We investigated the utility of (1) rare variants and variants known to be
  determinants of resistance for at least one drug and (2) machine and
  statistical learning architectures in predicting phenotypic drug resistance to
  10 anti-tuberculosis drugs

<a id="orgb58d5f6"></a>

## Conclusion

- Our approach allowed us to gain new insights into the relative im- portance of
  specific genetic variants for resistance prediction

- In summary, we present an exploration of machine learning and traditional
  statistical models to identify the resistance of MTB isolates to 10
  anti-tuberculosis drugs from whole genome sequencing data.

- Our models trained on rare and common genetic variants achieved
  state-of-the-art performance on a large, aggregated TB dataset, with
  prediction times of less than a tenth of a second, demonstrating the efficacy
  of our model as a diagnostic tool for MTB drug resistance.

- The MD-WDNN represented the first multidrug model to our knowledge that

incorporated a high number of genotypic predictors known to be important to
determining resistance for one or more included drugs

## FileName

- Ching2018<sub>OpportunitiesAndObstaclesForDLInBiology.pdf</sub>

<a id="org0461fe0"></a>

## Abstract

- Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has
  yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most
  pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the
  prior state of the art
- The limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some
  domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health
  records.

<a id="orge760b48"></a>

## Conclusion

- The most challenging tasks may be those in which predictions are used directly
  for downstream model- ling or decision-making, especially in the clinic. As an
  example, errors in sequence variant calling will be amplified if they are used
  directly for genome-wide association studies.

- In addition, the stochasticity and complexity of biological sys- tems imply
  that for some problems, for instance, predicting gene regulation in disease,
  perfect accuracy will be unattainable

# STRT Deelder2019 - Machine Learning Predicts Accurately Mycobacterium tuberculosis Drug Resistance From Whole Genome Sequencing Data

<a id="orgd200d9f"></a>

- Good ML oriented paper

<a id="orgeeb50ca"></a>

## FileName

- Deelder2019<sub>MLPredictsAccurately.pdf</sub>

<a id="orgde1a615"></a>

## Abstract

- We applied machine learning approaches to 16,688 M. tuberculosis isolates that
  have undergone WGS and laboratory drug-susceptibility testing (DST) across 14
  antituberculosis drugs, with 22.5% of samples being multidrug resistant and
  2.1% being extensively drug resistant.

- We fitted separate models for each drug, with and without “co-occurrent
  resistance” markers known to be causing resistance to drugs other than the one
  of interest. Predictive performance was measured using sensitivity,
  specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve,
  assuming DST results as the gold standard.

- Overall, the gradient-boosted-tree models performed better than the
  classification-tree models.

- Our work demonstrates the utility of machine learning as a flexible approach
  to drug resistance prediction that is able to accommodate a much larger number
  of predictors and to summarize their predictive ability, thus assisting
  clinical decision making and single nucleotide polymorphism detection in an
  era of increasing WGS data generation.

<a id="org670c0aa"></a>

## Conclusion

- The predictive performance was highest for resistance to first-line drugs,
  and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve above
  96%), and lowest for third- line drugs (area under the curve below 85%).

## Abstract

- Availability of trained radiologists for fast processing of CXRs in regions
  burdened with tuberculosis always has been a challenge, affecting both timely
  diagnosis and patient monitoring.

- The Qure.ai qXR arti- ficial intelligence automated CXR interpretation tool,
  was blind-tested on the 346 radiologist- annotated CXRs from the TBPP
  database.

- We conclude that applying fully automated Qure.ai CXR analysis tool is useful
  for fast, accurate, uniform, large-scale CXR annotation assistance, as it
  performed well even for DR-TB cases that were not used for initial training.

<a id="org54e1834"></a>

## Conclusion

- We demonstrated that the Qure.ai qXR CXR annotations for cavity, nodule,
  pleural effusion, and hilar lymphadenopathy, are in statistical agreement with
  radiologist CXR annotations.

- A corresponding analysis of patient case matched
  CT image annotations recorded within 30 days of a CXR supports this result,
  demonstrating statistical significance for cavity, pleural effusion, hilar
  lymphadenopathy, and atelectasis.

  covering machine classifi- cation, random forest classification, and random

- We demonstrate how model performance varies by drug, dataset, resistance
  metric, and species, reflecting the complexities of generating clinically

## Abstract

- Tuberculosis (TB) is a deadly contagious disease and a serious global health
  problem. It is curable but due to its lengthy treatment process, a patient is
  likely to leave the treatment incomplete, leading to a more lethal, drug
  resistant form of disease.

- We aim to facilitate TB programs by predicting the outcome of the treatment of
  a particular patient at the start of treatment so that their health workers
  can be utilized in a targeted and cost-effective way.

- The problem was modeled as a classification problem, and the outcome of
  treatment was predicted using state-of-art implementations of 3 machine learning algorithms

<a id="org29547e9"></a>

## Conclusion

- Empirical results using data of more than 4000 patients reveal that we can

  resistance in the genes rpoB, inhA, katG, pncA, gyrA and gyrB for the drugs
  rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and fluoroquinolones

- The single nucleotide variations were represented by several sequence and

## Conclusion

- The present study proposes an AI/ML method to classify resistant and susceptible
  mutations in TB and predict novel resistance conferring mutations.

- The impact of the reported mutations was captured in the form of changes in the amino acid
  residues, and the consequent change in properties vis-a-vis wild-type and mutant
  proteins and represented as features used to train the models.

- The classification model was generated for each gene and predictions were made for
  SNVs linked with each gene for each drug

## Abstract

- The many publicly available datasets describing its AMR characteristics demand

- Here, we develop a reference strain-agnostic computational platform that uses
  machine learning approaches, complemented by both genetic interaction analysis
  and 3D structural mutation-mapping, to identify signatures of AMR evolution to
  13 antibiotics.

- First, a pan-genome analysis shows that M. tuberculosis is highly conserved
  with sequenced variation concentrated in PE/PPE/PGRS genes.

- Second, the platform corroborates 33 genes known to confer resistance and identifies 24
  new genetic signatures of AMR.

- Third, 97 epistatic interactions across 10 resistance classes are revealed.

- Fourth, detailed structural analysis of these
  genes yields mechanistic bases for their selection.

- The platform can be used to study other human pathogens

<a id="org9355bfe"></a>

## Conclusion

- The platform was applied to 1595 sequenced strains to yield results in four
  categories: pan-genome properties, identification of genes conferring
  antibiotic resistance, their epistatic interactions, and protein structure
  based mechanistic insights.

## Abstract

- Development of an effective machine-learning model for T-cell Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) epitopes is beneficial for saving biologist’s
  time and effort for identifying epitope in a targeted antigen.

- The proposed method is able to work with variable length epitopes having size
  even greater than 9-mers. Identification of T-cell or B-cell epitopes in the
  targeted antigen is the main goal in designing epitope-based vaccine,
  immune-diagnostic tests and antibody production

- The proposed ensemble model achieves 82.0% accuracy, 0.89 specificity, 0.77
  sensitivity with repeated k-fold cross-validation having average accuracy of
  80.61%.

<a id="org598bb1f"></a>

## Conclusion

- Three models (decision tree, avNNet and RRF) have been used to design the
  ensemble model which produces high accuracy, Gini, AUC, specificity and
  sensitivity.

- To validate and compare the proposed ensemble model, NetMHC 4.0, NetMHC 2.3
  and CTLpred servers have been considered.

## Abstract

- Due to standard regimens for the use of first-line antibiotics, resistance
  co-occurrence, in which samples are resistant to multiple drugs, is common.
  Analysing all drugs simultaneously should therefore enable patterns reflecting
  resistance co-occurrence to be exploited for resistance prediction

- Here, multi-label random forest (MLRF) models are compared with single-label

## Abstract

- The goal of this work is to identify potent small molecule anti-TB agents by
  machine learning, synthesis and biological evaluation.

- The On-line Chemical Database and Modeling Environment (OCHEM) was used to
  build pre- dictive machine learning models. Seven compounds were synthesized
  and tested in vitro for their an- titubercular activity against H37Rv and
  resistant Mtb strains.

## Conclusion

- The goal of this work was to investigate isoniazid- thiazole hybrid compounds
  taking into consideration the key structural futures known to be important for
  their antituber- cular activity.

- The created binary classification models demonstrated good balanced accuracy.
  The predictive power of the binary classifiers was tested by a 5-fold cross-
  validation and resulted in balanced accuracies of 61–78 %. Seven new compounds
  were synthesized and their activity against Mtb H37Rv and MDR strains was
  evaluated at two concentrations (1.5 and 50 μМ) using rifampin and isoniazid
  as controls.

## Abstract

- We applied genetic programming approaches to understand the impact of
  descriptors on inhibitory effects of serine protease inhibitors of
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the discovery of new in- hibitors as drug
  candidates

- The experimental dataset of serine protease inhibitors of Mtb descriptors was
  optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) along with the correlation-based feature
  selection (CFS) in order to develop predictive models using machine-learning
  algorithms.

- The use of CFS-GA with random forest-enhanced classification accuracy and
  predicted new serine protease inhibitors of Mtb, which can be used for better
  drug development against tuberculosis.

<a id="orgbf53cc8"></a>

## Conclusion

- Comparative analysis of statistical measures for four different
  machine-learning algorithms revealed that RF models with CFS-GA performed
  better than the others.

- The best RF models with CFS-GA predicted new serine protease inhibitors of
  Mtb, which can be used for better drug development against tuberculosis

- The need to develop new treatments for those infected with Mycobacterium

- We have curated small molecule Mtb data and developed new models with a total
  of 18,886 molecules with activity cutoffs of 10 μM, 1 μM, and 100 nM. These
  data sets were used to evaluate different machine learning methods (including
  deep learning) and metrics and to generate predictions for additional
  molecules published in 2017

- We have also compared these models with additional machine learning algorithms
  showing Bayesian machine learning models con- structed with literature Mtb
  data generated by different laboratories generally were equivalent to or
  outperformed deep neural networks with external test sets.

## Abstract

- Identifying biomarkers for tuberculosis (TB) is an ongoing challenge in
  developing immuno- logical correlates of infection outcome and protection.

- To effectively predict biomarkers for infection progression in any disease,
  including TB, large amounts of experi- mental data are required to reach
  statistical power and make accurate predictions.

- Machine learning techniques were used to interrogate the experimental NHP
  datasets without identifying any potential TB biomarker. In parallel, we used
  our extensive novel NHP datasets to build and calibrate a multi-organ
  computational model that combines what is occurring at the site of infection
  (e.g., lung) at a single granuloma scale with blood level readouts that can be
  tracked in mon- keys and humans.

## FileName

<a id="org16a2f4a"></a>

## Abstract

- The major advantage of multiple-instance learning (MIL) applied to a
  computer-aided detection (CAD) system is that it allows optimizing the latter
  with case-level labels instead of accurate lesion outlines as traditionally
  required for a supervised approach.

- As shown in previous work, a MIL-based CAD system can perform comparably to
  its supervised counterpart considering complex tasks such as chest radiograph
  scoring in tuberculosis (TB) detection. However, despite this remarkable
  achievement, the uncertainty inherent to MIL can lead to a less satisfactory
  outcome if analysis at lower levels (e.g., regions or pixels) is needed.

- To minimize the labeling effort, we develop a novel instance selection
  mechanism that exploits the MIL problem definition through one-class
  classification.

## FileName

- Ngo2019<sub>GenomicPrediction.pdf</sub>

<a id="org1d383b6"></a>

## Abstract

- It is possible to predict whether a tuberculosis (TB) patient will fail to
  respond to specific antibiotics by sequencing the genome of the infecting
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and observing whether the pathogen carries
  specific mutations at drug-resistance sites.

- Here, we evaluate the performance of four popular tools (TBProfiler, MyKrobe,
  KvarQ, PhyResSE) with 6746 isolates compiled from publicly available
  databases, and subsequently identify highly probable phenotyping errors in the
  databases by genetically predicting the drug phenotypes using all four
  software.

- Our results show that these bioinformatics tools generally perform well in
  predicting the resistance status for two key first-line agents (isoniazid,
  rifampicin), but the accuracy is lower for second-line injectables and
  fluoroquinolones.

<a id="org4feb753"></a>

## Conclusion

- The use of whole-genome sequencing to replace conventional laboratory-based
  drug-susceptibility testing reduces the time taken to culture and test against
  individual drugs, but requires sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms to be
  designed and validated to translate the genetic information into drug
  susceptibility phenotypes.

- Using latent class modeling, we have identi- fied which isolates in the
  existing databases are likely to present erroneous DST phenotypes and
  recalibrated the performance of these bioinformatics software adjusting for
  errors in the existing databases.

- However, we still observe low sensitivity in detecting resistance to ETO,
  PAS, PTO, and PZA.

- Without a clear understanding to the genetic biomarkers of drug resistance or
  to their pene- trance, or at least more powerful algorithms that can pick up
  additional intricacies of resistance across multiple drugs, such as what have
  been done for HIV and cancer [22–24], the ability to successfully predict the
  presence of drug-resistance is reduced.

## Abstract

- Recent reports suggest that Mtb has been developing resistance to the widely
  used anti-tubercular drugs resulting in the emergence and spread of multi
  drug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains throughout
  the world.

- Whole organism screens on the other hand are target-agnostic and have been now

  by the time and cost involved in running the screens for large compound
  libraries.

## Abstract

- Identifying and understanding the risk factors for endemic bovine tuberculosis
  (TB) in cattle herds is critical for the control of this disease. Exploratory
  machine learning techniques can uncover complex non-linear relation- ships and
  interactions within disease causation webs, and enhance our knowledge of TB
  risk factors and how they are interrelated.

- The best classification tree models informed multivariable binomial logistic
  regression models in each area, adding statistical inference outputs. These
  two approaches showed similar predictive performance although there were some
  disparities regarding what constituted high-risk predictors.

- Decision tree machine learning approaches can identify risk factors from webs
  of causation: information which may then be used to inform decision making for
  disease control purposes.

- Alterations in pathogen genomes are among the main mechanisms by which

- Analysis of 144 M. tuberculosis strains of different phenotypes including drug
  susceptible, MDR and XDR isolated in Belarus was fulfilled in this paper. A
  wide range of machine learning methods that can discover SNPs related to
  drug-resistance in the whole bacteria genomes was investigated

- Besides single-SNP testing approaches, methods that allow detecting joint
  effects from interacting SNPs were considered.

- Analysis of whole-genome sequences often leads to situations where the number
  of treated features exceeds the number of available observations. For this
  reason, special attention is paid to fair evaluation of the model prediction
  quality and minimizing the risk of overfitting while estimating the underlying
  parameters.

## Abstract

- The mycobacterial cell envelope has been implicated in the pathogenicity of

  characterization of surface proteins with potential application in drug and
  vaccine development.

- In this study, the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  H37Rv was screened using Machine Learning tools that included feature-based
  predictors, general localizers and transmembrane topology predictors to
  identify proteins that are potentially secreted to the surface of M.
  tuberculosis, or to the extracellular milieu through different secretory
  pathways.

- Surface localization was also confirmed for the positive controls, whereas
  negative controls were located on the cytoplasm. Based on statistical learning
  methods, we obtained computational subcellular localization predictions that
  were experimentally assessed and allowed us to construct a computational
  protocol with experimental support that allowed us to identify a new set of
  secreted/surface proteins as potential vaccine candidates.

## Abstract

- Given the availability of DNA sequencing data from MTB, we developed machine
  learning models for a cohort of 1839 UK bacterial isolates to classify MTB
  resistance against eight anti- TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol,
  pyrazinamide, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, streptomycin) and to
  classify multi-drug resistance.

<a id="org740926e"></a>

## Conclusion

- We performed both principal component analysis (PCA) and a sparse logistic
  version (SL-PCA) to explore the underlying structure of genetic variation
  within our cohort of bacterial isolates.

- Among the machine learning classifiers, PM and SVM-RBF rank as the top two
  best-performing classifiers overall. The former integrates prior knowledge of
  resistance determinant explicitly (though prior knowledge about susceptibility
  determinants, lineage defining SNPs and compensatory mutations was not
  included), and the latter suggests that the method’s nonlinear model is
  suitable for unveiling nonlinear rela- tionships among mutations in terms of
  resistance association for INH, CIP and SM.

- This work showed great potentials of machine learning in improving resistance
  classification given high-dimensional genetic data, especially when the
  underlying biological resistance mecha- nism is poorly understood for many
  drugs

## Abstract

- Existing methods based on genetic data analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  (MTB) have been able to predict resistance of MTB to individual drugs, but
  have not considered the resistance co-occurrence and cannot capture latent
  structure of genomic data that corresponds to lineages.

- We then proposed an end-to-end multi-task model with deep denoising
  auto-encoder (DeepAMR) for multiple drug classification and developed
  DeepAMR<sub>cluster</sub>, a clustering variant based on DeepAMR, for learning clusters
  in latent space of the data.

- The resistance prediction for the MTB is essentially a multi-label learn- ing
  problem, where each isolate is resistant to a subset of the examined drugs.
  The input is mutations for individual isolates, such that the pres- ence of a
  SNP variable is denoted as one and zero otherwise

- We only considered cross-resistance between four first-line drugs but ignored
  that of second-line drugs because: (i) the inaccurate phenotyping for
  second-line drugs would introduce large error in the classification for
  first-line drugs and (ii) a small number of resistant isolates would result in
  over-fitting easily for such a complex model.

## Abstract

- DosR is an important regulator of the response to stress such as limited
  oxygen availability in Mycobacterium tuberculosis

- Most of the approaches capture only a first-order approximation to the complex
  transcriptional processes by assuming linear gene responses and linear
  dynamics in TFA, or ignore the temporal information in data from such systems.

- Our reconstructed TFA is closer to the experimentally determined profile of
  p53 concentration than that from the original study.
